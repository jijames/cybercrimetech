In 2013, I was the moderator of a panel discussion dealing cyber crime and cyber security at the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace (Youth Forum) 2013. At that panel, I met
Nikolay Akatyev. He was an essay finalist with the topic "Proposal of Policy to Create International Cyber Peacekeepers". His proposal was the
just start of an idea, but I thought it was very interesting. After that meeting, we discussed the idea further, 
and eventually decided to expand it. In 2015, we finally published "[Cyber Peacekeeping](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-25512-5_10)" 
at the International Conference on Digital Forensics and Cyber Crime 2015. In that publication we outlined the 
tasks, scope and organizational framework that could be the basis of Cyber Peacekeeping. We tried to make the content 
as practical as possible. In later works, we looked at legal requirements for establishing Cyber Peacekeeping, and 
most recently we finished  paper showing that the UN's [Digital Blue Helmets](https://unite.un.org/digitalbluehelmets/) could 
potentially be a good start to Cyber Peacekeeping, but - for now - does not cover anywhere near the scope required 
for real peacekeeping efforts in cyberspace.
